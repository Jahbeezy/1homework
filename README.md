## Description

-For this project I needed to debug the Horiseon webpage HTML and CSS, clean up redundant code and organize with proper semantics.

-Adding an ID to the search engine under contents connected it to the href allowing the page link to work properly.

-There was a significant amount of code that provided the same function so I was able to reduce the redundancy by connecting them to a single Class/CSS style.

-In the HTML I was able to create organization by properly tagging the Header, Footer, and replacing divs within divs with setcions. 

-I learned how to create comprehensive code with HTML semantics and how to identify and clean up repetative code.
