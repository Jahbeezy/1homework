## Description
---
    -For this project I needed to debug the Horiseon webpage HTML and CSS, clean up redundant code and organize with proper semantics.

    -Adding an ID to the search engine under 'contents' class connected it to the 'href' allowing the page link to work properly.

    -There was a significant amount of code that provided the same function so I was able to reduce the redundancy by connecting them to a single Class and CSS style.

    -In the HTML I was able to create organization by properly tagging the Header, Footer, and replacing divs within divs with sections and other tags. 

    -I learned how to create comprehensive code with HTML semantics and how to identify and clean up repetative code.
